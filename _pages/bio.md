I am dedicated to advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a specific focus on enhancing efficiency and robustness. Throughout my PhD, I conducted research in the following key areas:

Efficient AI:
+ Investigating the intersection between human rationales and model attention to enhance AI systems' learning capabilities, particularly in low-resource conditions.
+ Developing innovative meta-learning techniques that leverage distributional signatures to achieve improved performance in few-shot classification scenarios.

Robust AI:
+ Identifying and mitigating spurious correlations by contrasting data environments, ensuring the reliability and integrity of AI systems.
+ Promoting fairness and impartiality in AI algorithms through the transfer of knowledge of biases across different tasks.
+ Detecting hidden data biases by leveraging hard splits that prevent predictors from generalizing. We have developed an algorithm to automatically learn these hard splits from the labeled data.

In addition to my academic research, I gained invaluable practical experience during my time at [Emerald Innovations](https://emeraldinno.com). There, I had the opportunity to develop cutting-edge algorithms for wireless sensing, focusing on harnessing RF signals to extract precise and comprehensive metrics related to various aspects of human functionality. Specifically, my work involved analyzing mobility patterns, gait characteristics, behavioral dynamics, and vital indicators such as respiration, sleep quality, and sleep stages. This hands-on experience further deepened my understanding of real-world applications and the potential of AI in enhancing human well-being."

Currently, as a vital member of the Advanced Machine Learning team at [insitro](https://insitro.com/about), I am actively involved in the development of robust image representations. Our objective is to ensure these representations exhibit exceptional performance in terms of out-of-distribution generalization and resilience to batch effects. By equipping vision transformers with context conditioning, we are striving to overcome the challenges posed by covariate shifts and ensure the reliability and stability of AI models when confronted with varying data distributions. This work enables us to unlock the full potential of AI algorithms in analyzing complex visual data and paves the way for transformative applications in computational biology.

Through my work, I strive to contribute to the advancement of AI by addressing efficiency, robustness, and real-world applications, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what is possible in this exciting field.
