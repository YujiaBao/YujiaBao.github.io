Hello! I'm a machine learning researcher with a background in Mathematics. I've been immersed in this field since 2016 and have had the opportunity to work on some fascinating projects.


##### **Developing NLP Systems with Minimal Task-Dependent Annotations**
I've focused on creating more efficient NLP systems that require fewer task-specific annotations. My key contributions include:
+ Enhancing data efficiency by aligning human rationales with attention models.<sup>1</sup>
+ Constructing distributional signatures for few-shot text classification.<sup>2</sup>


##### **Addressing Bias in Machine Learning**
I firmly believe that fairness in machine learning is crucial, especially as biased datasets can lead to biased models. My work in this area includes:
+ Mitigating spurious correlations by contrasting different data environments.<sup>3</sup>
+ Transferring the knowledge of biases across tasks.<sup>4</sup>
+ Automatic bias discovery by learning challening splits from labeled datasets.<sup>5</sup>


##### **Advancing Foundational Models for Cell Imaging**
In the realm of cell imaging, I've been at the forefront of developing foundational models. My work includes:
+ Enhancing vision transformers with context pre-conditioning for improved generalization over distribution shifts.<sup>6</sup>
+ Enabling cross-channel and cross-position reasoning for vision transformers on multi-channel imaging.<sup>7</sup>

I'm driven by my love for learning and the excitement that comes from creating something new. Each day offers a new chance to explore and innovate, which I find truly thrilling.
