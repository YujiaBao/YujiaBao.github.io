Tofu [grew up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-X0U0RWxnc&t=136s) in Cambridge.
She is always energetic and loves to [play
🏖️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lhvUkfgupw&t=2s).
As an MIT girl, she recognizes numbers (by woof woof) and has learned ~30
tricks (certified by the [AKC trick dog
title](https://www.akc.org/sports/trick-dog/)).
While she crossed the rainbow bridge to play with the geese, her spirit will
always be with us.

Yumi doesn't like to play with strangers. A shy shy little girl ☺️
However, once she knows you, she will play like crazy 🤪
Yumi loves singing 🎵 and stealing delicious human food 🌭🍔🍕
<!--She has recently given birth to five little pups ⚡️⚡️⚡️-->
<!--Yumi came as a ray of light to my life -->
<!--Her unimaginable sweetness took me out of the sorrow.-->
<!--As a multiple puppy group winner, she is absolutely beautiful.-->
<!--Since she grew up in suburb, she is now getting used to the city environment.-->
<!--While she pretend to be shy for now, I can see her hidden playful and child-like mindset.-->

Sabre is the SWEETEST samoyed on the planet 🍭
<!--He is curious and fearless.-->
<!--While Tofu sometimes will get annoyed if you pet her for toooo long (´･ω･`),-->
He enjoys human attention for **hours**.
The big soft boy simply brings happiness to everyone ↖(^ω^)↗
<!--Like his name (Sabre Dance), he has a bouncy bouncy movement when he walks.-->
<!--I have no doubt that he will become a perfect threapy dog after he completes his-->
<!--obediance training.-->
