Tofu [grew up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-X0U0RWxnc&t=136s) in Cambridge.
She is always energetic and loves to [play
🏖️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lhvUkfgupw&t=2s).
As an MIT girl, she recognizes numbers (by woof woof) and has learned ~30
tricks (certified by the [AKC trick dog
title](https://www.akc.org/sports/trick-dog/)).
While she crossed the rainbow bridge to play with the geese, her spirit will
always be with us.

<!--She has recently given birth to five little pups ⚡️⚡️⚡️-->
<!--Yumi came as a ray of light to my life -->
<!--Her unimaginable sweetness took me out of the sorrow.-->
<!--As a multiple puppy group winner, she is absolutely beautiful.-->

<!--While she pretend to be shy for now, I can see her hidden playful and child-like mindset.-->
