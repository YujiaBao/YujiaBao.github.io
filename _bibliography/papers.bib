  abstract={Classifiers are biased when trained on biased datasets. As a remedy,
            we propose Learning to Split (ls), an algorithm for automatic bias
            detection. Given a dataset with input-label pairs, ls learns to
            split this dataset so that predictors trained on the training split
            generalize poorly to the testing split. This performance gap
            provides a proxy for measuring the degree of bias in the learned
            features and can therefore be used to reduce biases. Identifying
            non-generalizable splits is challenging as we don't have any
            explicit annotations about how to split. In this work, we show that
            the prediction correctness of the testing example can be used as a
            source of weak supervision: generalization performance will drop if
            we move examples that are predicted correctly away from the testing
            split, leaving only those that are mispredicted. We evaluate our
            approach on Beer Review, Waterbirds, CelebA and MNLI. Empirical
            results show that ls is able to generate astonishingly challenging
            splits that correlate with human-identified biases. Moreover, we
            demonstrate that combining robust learning algorithms (such as group
            DRO) with splits identified by ls enables automatic de-biasing.
            Compared with previous state-of-the-arts, we substantially improves
            the worst-group performance (23.4\% on average) when the source of
            biases is unknown during training and validation.

              we hypothesize that the unstable features in the source task and

              informing the target classifier of the source task's unstable
              features, we can regularize the biases in the target task.
              Specifically, we derive a representation that encodes the unstable
              features by contrasting different data environments in the source
              task. On the target task, we cluster data from this

            assess the disease spectrum of gastric cancer susceptibility genes
            and to develop a comprehensive resource of gene–disease associations
            for clinicians. Twenty-seven potential germline gastric cancer
            susceptibility genes were identified from three review articles and
            from six commonly used genetic information resources. The diseases
            associated with each gene were evaluated via a semi-structured
            review of six genetic resources and an additional literature review
            using a natural language processing (NLP)-based procedure. Out of 27
            candidate genes, 13 were identified as gastric cancer susceptibility
            genes (APC, ATM, BMPR1A, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
            MUTYH-Biallelic, PALB2, SMAD4, and STK11). A total of 145
            gene–disease associations (with 45 unique diseases) were found to be
            associated with these 13 genes. Other gastrointestinal cancers were
            prominent among identified associations, with 11 of 13 gastric
            cancer susceptibility genes also associated with colorectal cancer,
            eight genes associated with pancreatic cancer, and seven genes

  journal={Annals of Surgical Oncology},
  publisher={Springer International Publishing},
  abstract={Background: The prevalence of non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) is
            increasing worldwide. Although most NMTCs grow slowly, conventional
            therapies are less effective in advanced tumors. Approximately 5–15%
            of NMTCs have a significant germline genetic component. Awareness of
            the NMTC susceptibility genes may lead to earlier diagnosis and
            better cancer prevention.  Objective: The aim of this study was to
            provide the current panorama of susceptibility genes associated with
            NMTC and the spectrum of diseases associated with these genes.
            Methods: Twenty-five candidate genes were identified by searching
            for relevant studies in PubMed. Each candidate gene was carefully
            checked using six authoritative genetic resources: ClinGen, National
            Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, Online Mendelian
            Inheritance in Man, Genetics Home Reference, GeneCards, and
            Gene-NCBI, and a validated natural language processing (NLP)-based
            literature review protocol was used to further assess gene–disease
            associations where there was ambiguity.  Results: Among 25 candidate
            genes, 10 (APC, DICER1, FOXE1, HABP2, NKX2-1, PRKAR1A, PTEN, SDHB,
            SDHD, and SRGAP1) were verified among the six genetic resources. Two
            additional genes, CHEK2 and SEC23B, were verified using the NLP
            protocol. Seventy-nine diseases were found to be associated with
            these 12 NMTC susceptibility genes. The following diseases were
            associated with more than one NMTC susceptibility gene: colorectal
            cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, kidney cancer,
            gastrointestinal stromal tumor, paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma, and
            benign skin conditions.  Conclusion: Twelve genes predisposing to
            NMTC and their associated disease spectra were identified and
            verified. Clinicians should be aware that patients with certain
            pathogenic variants may require more aggressive surveillance beyond
            their thyroid cancer risk.},

  abstract={Background: Pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes can
            increase the risk of a spectrum of diseases, which clinicians must
            manage for their patients. We evaluated the disease spectrum of
            breast cancer susceptibility genes (BCSGs) with the aim of
            developing a comprehensive resource of gene-disease associations for
            clinicians. Methods: Twelve genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1,
            CHEK2, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, RECQL, STK11, and TP53), all of which have
            been conclusively established as BCSGs by the Clinical Genome
            Resource (ClinGen) and/or the NCCN guidelines, were investigated.
            The potential gene-disease associations for these 12 genes were
            verified and evaluated based on six genetic resources (ClinGen,
            NCCN, OMIM, Genetics Home Reference, GeneCards, and Gene-NCBI) and
            an additional literature review using a semiautomated natural
            language processing (NLP) abstract classification procedure.
            Results: Forty-two diseases were found to be associated with one or
            more of the 12 BCSGs for a total of 86 gene-disease associations, of
            which 90% (78/86) were verified by ClinGen and/or NCCN. Four
            gene-disease associations could not be verified by either ClinGen or
            NCCN but were verified by at least three of the other four genetic
            resources. Four gene-disease associations were verified by the NLP
            procedure alone.  Conclusion: This study is unique in that it
            systematically investigates the reported disease spectrum of BCSGs
            by surveying multiple genetic resources and the literature with the
            aim of developing a single consolidated, comprehensive resource for
            clinicians. This innovative approach provides a general guide for
            evaluating gene-disease associations for BCSGs, potentially
            improving the clinical management of at-risk individuals.},

Meta-learning has shown strong performance in computer vision, where low-level patterns are transferable across learning tasks. However, directly applying this approach to text is challenging--words highly informative for one task may have little significance for another. Thus, rather than learning solely from words, our model also leverages their distributional signatures, which encode pertinent word occurrence patterns. Our model is trained within a meta-learning framework to map these signatures into attention scores, which are then used to weight the lexical representations of words. We demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms prototypical networks in both few-shot text classification and relation classification by a significant margin across six benchmark datasets (19.96\% on average in 1-shot classification).},

  abstract={The medical literature has been growing exponentially, and its size
            has become a barrier for physicians to locate and extract clinically
            useful information. As a promising solution, natural language
            processing (NLP), especially machine learning (ML)‐based NLP is a
            technology that potentially provides a promising solution. ML‐based
            NLP is based on training a computational algorithm with a large
            number of annotated examples to allow the computer to “learn” and
            “predict” the meaning of human language. Although NLP has been
            widely applied in industry and business, most physicians still are
            not aware of the huge potential of this technology in medicine, and
            the implementation of NLP in breast cancer research and management
            is fairly limited. With a real‐world successful project of
            identifying penetrance papers for breast and other cancer
            susceptibility genes, this review illustrates how to train and
            evaluate an NLP‐based medical abstract classifier, incorporate it
            into a semiautomatic meta‐analysis procedure, and validate the
            effectiveness of this procedure. Other implementations of NLP
            technology in breast cancer research, such as parsing pathology
            reports and mining electronic healthcare records, are also
            discussed. We hope this review will help breast cancer physicians

abstract = {PURPOSE: Quantifying the risk of cancer associated with pathogenic mutations in germline cancer susceptibility genes—that is, penetrance—enables the personalization of preventive management strategies. Conducting a meta-analysis is the best way to obtain robust risk estimates. We have previously developed a natural language processing (NLP) –based abstract classifier which classifies abstracts as relevant to penetrance, prevalence of mutations, both, or neither. In this work, we evaluate the performance of this NLP-based procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the semiautomated NLP-based procedure, which involves automated abstract classification and text mining, followed by human review of identified studies, with the traditional procedure that requires human review of all studies. Ten high-quality gene–cancer penetrance meta-analyses spanning 16 gene–cancer associations were used as the gold standard by which to evaluate the performance of our procedure. For each meta-analysis, we evaluated the number of abstracts that required human review (workload) and the ability to identify the studies that were included by the authors in their quantitative analysis (coverage). RESULTS: Compared with the traditional procedure, the semiautomated NLP-based procedure led to a lower workload across all 10 meta-analyses, with an overall 84\% reduction (2,774 abstracts v 16,941 abstracts) in the amount of human review required. Overall coverage was 93\%—we are able to identify 132 of 142 studies—before reviewing references of identified studies. Reasons for the 10 missed studies included blank and poorly written abstracts. After reviewing references, nine of the previously missed studies were identified and coverage improved to 99\% (141 of 142 studies). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that an NLP-based procedure can significantly reduce the review workload without compromising the ability to identify relevant studies. NLP algorithms have promising potential for reducing human efforts in the literature review process. }

abstract = {PURPOSE: The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing exponentially. Clinicians need tools monitoring and prioritizing the literature to understand the clinical implications of the pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as relevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or prevalence of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule based on the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance classification, we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and evaluated the two models using 10-fold cross-validation. The SVM model achieves 88.93% accuracy (percentage of papers that were correctly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.53 % accuracy. For prevalence classification, we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieves 88.92% accuracy while the CNN model achieves 88.52 % accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review, this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning knowledge of gene-cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical decision support tools up to date.},

Our central hypothesis is that this mapping is general across domains, and thus can be transferred from resource-rich domains to low-resource ones.

This thesis systematically studied the RRQR algorithms. The main contributions are summarized as following:
1. This thesis presents a systematic review of three kinds of widely-used and high- performance RRQR algorithms. I extend some existing theorems and indepen- dently complete some parts of the theoretical analysis.
2. Based on the existing methods, I propose a new greedy strong RRQR algorithm for computing a strong RRQR factorization. The new algorithm greatly improves the time efficiency of the origin algorithm.
3. I design a series of numerical experiments to show the computation characteristics of different kinds of algorithms.
Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that both the origin strong RRQR al- gorithm and the new greedy strong RRQR algorithm can promise a strong RRQR fac- torization while the new algorithm is significantly faster than the origin algorithm. For rank deficient problem, RRQR factorization gives satisfactory computation accuracy while it is much more efficient than the traditional method, which involves computing the SVD.},
